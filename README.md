# KeyboardPlusPlus

Have you ever wanted to input more chars using your keyboard? Are you tired of searching the web just to find a symbol and copy-pasting it? Worry no more! This program allows you to input additional characters using your keyboard.

# Usage:

Start the .exe file, press F6 to open settings and set up your binds by clicking the add/delete buttons and modifying text boxes. When you're finished, press save.
To send a character, press down your modifier key and press a key that you have bound to a symbol. 
All your binds can be found in the binds.json file
